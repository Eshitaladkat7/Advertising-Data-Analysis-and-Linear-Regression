# Advertising-Data-Analysis-and-Linear-Regression
This data science project analyzes the relationship between TV advertising budgets and sales using Python and linear regression. A linear regression model is built to predict sales, with steps including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation (R², Mean Squared Error), and visualization.

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of linear regression to analyze and predict sales based on advertising budgets for TV. It uses Python for data preprocessing, visualization, and building the regression model.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Exploration of the dataset for understanding relationships between variables.
- **Linear Regression Model**: Trains a simple linear regression model using Scikit-learn.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Calculates R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for the model's performance.
- **Visualization**: Plots the regression line and training data points.
- **Prediction**: Predicts sales for a given advertising budget.
